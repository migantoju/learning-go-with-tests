# Select

### For this, we will be using:
- `net/http` to make the HTTP calls
- `net/http/httptest` to help use test them
- `goroutines`
- `select` to synchronise processes

`Select` Helps you to wait multiple channels

`httptest`
- A convenient way of creating test servers so you can have reliable and controllable tests.
- Using the same interfaces as the real.
